DEVELOPMENT LOGS
---------------

1. [June 30, 2014 by Jimmy] Develop exact line search to accelerate the convergence of
   frank-wolfe algorithm. This modification significantly enhance the
   performance of frank-wolfe algorithm. We compare the iteration number of
   converging first subproblem objective function to 22 with 35(**exact line search**) / 82(**inexact line search**). 
   
2. [June 30, 2014 by Jimmy] We trace the finally converged result and found that the
   element of resulted **W** is not stricly either 0 or 1. That means
   belonging of instances is fuzzier than our expectation. (**why???**) Furthermore, we
   trace the number of cluster centroids varies with regard to the **Overall iteration number** as follows:  

    iter  nCentroid
    100   about 60
    200   about 40
    300   about 30

   (***why???***) However, the synthetic dataset is generated by means of four
   acutal clustered centroid with some noises. 

3. [June 30, 2014 by Jimmy] We refine the mechanism of **managing variable
   dumping works** with macros definition at the very beginning of code script.
